			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create an introduction about yourself and your interests in your homepage index.html. Including at least one div, one heading, and paragraph tags where necessary. Followed by adding an image of ourselves within the html.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem I encountered was that my image uploaded onto the webpage in a massive size. And when editing this in the css folder at first it did not work with a # infrom of the class and needed a . infront of the class to function properly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went well. We were able to follow the directions with minimal errors or bumps in the road. Which we were able to overcome by working together and putting that extra effort in to find the answer.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Here you can see the index.html file for the hompage and lab3. And on the left side of the vscode files you can see the file structure that's been made:</p>
