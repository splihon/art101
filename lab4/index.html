			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The Challenge of this lab was to create a psuedocode for an everyday task and a psuedocode for a simple computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had a bit of a difficult time when it came to organize the list so that it would not look like one big paragraph. But we solved this by useing li and ul.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This challenge went well, we spent some time trying our best to understand the specifics in the instructions and then following them to the best of our ability so hopefully all it is following his directions. </p>

					<p>Hangman</p>
							<pre><code>
  // Select a random word
  // Set the number of maximum attempts (e.g., 6)
  // Create an empty list to store guessed letters
  // Set the game state to "in progress"

  // Main game loop
  // While the game is in progress:
  //     Display the hangman ASCII art corresponding to the number of incorrect guesses
  //     Display the current state of the word with underscores for unguessed letters and the correctly guessed letters
  //     Display the letters that have already been guessed
  //     Prompt the player to guess a letter
  //     Validate the input:
  //         If the input is not a single letter or has already been guessed, display an error message and ask for input again
  //     If the guessed letter is in the word:
  //         Update the word display to reveal the guessed letter(s)
  //     Else:
  //         Decrement the number of remaining attempts
  //         If the remaining attempts reach 0:
  //             Set the game state to "lost" and break out of the loop
  //     If all letters in the word have been guessed:
  //         Set the game state to "won" and break out of the loop

  // Display the game outcome
  // If the game state is "won":
  //     Display a congratulatory message
  // Else:
  //     Display a message indicating the correct word and that the player lost
